Instructions:
- Download as zip
- Expand zip
- Install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer), IF you don't already have it
- Then, open "index.js" in whatever editor, and change the Username, Account ID (You can find it on GDBROWSER), Password, the Comment, Percentage, et cetera. (make sure they still have quotation marks around them)
- DONT CHANGE THE SECRET!
- Run "node index.js" in your Terminal

ERRORS:
- Most common one is "failed ratelimited." This is almost never a problem with the program - it means your account is ratelimited OR it actually did work, and it is a false positive.
- Any other errors are the programs fault. Email me PLEASE about them at thekxcamb@gmail.com
