Instructions:
- Download as zip
- Expand zip
- Install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer), IF you don't already have it
- Run "node index.js" in your Terminal

ERRORS:
- Most common one is "failed ratelimited." This is almost never a problem with the program - it means your account is ratelimited OR it actually did work, and it is a false positive.
- Any other errors are the programs fault. Email me PLEASE about them at thekxcamb@gmail.com
